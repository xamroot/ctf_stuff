# Crypto Challenge 6: Rivest Shamir Adleman
## Investigation
So this challenge provided a zip file that contained 10 files. I began by looking at the two python files "encrypt.py" and "generate_keys.py". The encrypt file did not tell me anything new because the challenge description informs us that this is someone's implementation of RSA. So I move onto the generate_keys file.
